# DungeonMasterTool
A tool to assist DMs in D&D Games by providing a few basic tasks and providing easy access to common information requirements.

The tool connects to the https://www.dnd5eapi.co API.  It downloads and organises the following items:

Equipment
Spells
Classes
Monsters
Conditions
Rules

The tool also has a battle mode and a dice rolling screen.  The dice rolling screen allows for the rolling of any number of dice of any type (D20, D6 etc.)

The battle prepare mode allows for selection of NPC characters - the AC/HP of NPC characters is automatically updated.  
Initiative rolls for NPC characters are automatically created - any modifiers can be manually added.

PC Characters are also added on this screen.  Once ready, clicking the "Battle" button organises the characters by initiative in a list with AC displayed.

An amendable field for HP exists that can be changed manually during combat.

Each press of the ATTACK button will reorder the list by initiative.  

Once a characters HP is reduced to 0 they are removed from the list.
